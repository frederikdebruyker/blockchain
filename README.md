## JS blockchain
### Libraries
- For hash function, need to install crypto-js library for SHA256: npm install --save crypto-js
- For signing function, need to install elliptic library: npm install elliptic
### Development object(s)
- blockchainBasics.js
- blockchainTransactions.js
- blockchain.js
- blockchainSigning.js
### Functionality
- Block definition
- Block chain definition
- Block chain validation
- Proof-of-Work (= mining) with 'difficulty' for increased security
- Transactions from / to
- Signing transactions (with class modularization)
### Run
In terminal window: in directory of development object: **node `<development object with extension>`**
